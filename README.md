# Bomb Defuse

A terminal-based puzzle game featuring a moody, glitchy robot assistant. You play as an operator controlling the robot through a terminal. Your task is to defuse a bomb by sending commands to your robot.

However, the robot may not always follow your orders. There is a stress mechanism: every command or action increases the robot's stress level. When the robot is stressed, it may stop listening to you and start making excuses. Also, while you are typing commands, random ads might pop up to make typing more challenging.
